## Introduction

After initial discussion with course staff, I was advised to choose a
condition that would have abundant available bulk-RNA data. I was
interested in various forms of lung cancer, because of its well known
lethality and difficulty to treat. To limit the difficulty and scope of
the project, I was advised to choose a type of non-small cell lung
cancer. This is because it is a lot harder to get rigorously
representative expression data for small-cell lung cancer. I chose lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), because as of 2023, it was the most common form
of NSCLC. This means it is both a high-impact therapeutic target, and
likely to have more accessible data associated with it. Lung cancer as a
whole continues to be one of the most urgent cancers to characterize,
diagnose, and treat. Five-year survival rates remain low even in 2024,
at around 28.4% nationally according to the American Lung Association,
and this is after an improvement of 26% in the last five years due to
advancements in medical technology. (American Lung Association, 2024)
Lung cancer becomes significantly less survivable as the disease
progresses, with survival rates falling exponentially with disease
progression. A main aspect of how LUAD cases are described is classical
classification into stages, I through IV. (Myers & Wallen, 2023) Cancer
staging is based on the [primary] tumor, nodal spread, and distant
metastases (TMN) components, which are physiological descriptions of the
extent and severity of the tumor pathology. (Gonz√°lez-Rivas & Fieira,
2021) However, how LUAD cases progress from one stage to the next
genetically remains the subject of ongoing research, because LUAD
well-known for a high degree of patient heterogeneity in response to
treatment. Thus, if there are expression pathways common among all LUAD
progression trajectories, these could be invaluable targets for
prognosis and treatment targeting. (Wu et al., 2021) With all this in
mind, I thought it would be interesting to characterize the different
expression profiles of stage I and stage IV LUAD. As both stages have a
variety of subtypes, this would be a more general, high-level
comparison. My question was, "what are the most significant ways that
the transcriptomic profiles of stage I and stage IV differ from one
another?". Indirectly, answering this question could help answer how
LUAD progresses and how to proactively choose the best treatment. My
hypothesis was, if comparing stage I and stage IV LUAD, one will be able
to observe clearly distinct expression profiles, perhaps with genes
relating to DNA replication and mitosis being upregulated, reflecting
increased tumor growth. This was somewhat vague, but I lacked adequate
background knowledge to have any more specific biological processes or
specific pathways in mind.

<br>

## Results

My results generally confirmed my hypothesis, as well as provided
additional insights for future directions. Using the class exercises as
an example, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), differential
gene expression analysis (DGEA or DEA), gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA), and GO term enrichment analysis. Based on background knowledge,
I was not expecting stage I and stage IV to be difficult to distinguish
with respect to expression profiles, and this was supported by the data.
As seen in figure 11, there were as many as 9,300 significantly
differentiated genes discovered by DEA. This could be clearly seen in
the scaled heatmap in figure 12, as well as the PCA plots in figure 10.
Figure 13 identifies many genes with both large fold changes, high
significance, or both. All could be explored further depending on the
intention and direction of future research questions. Since my research
question and hypothesis were very vague, the existence of significant
genes themselves already confirmed my hypothesis. If I had a more
specific gene or set of genes already in mind, I could use figure 13 to
confirm whether this gene was upregulated or downregulated, and whether
this regulation had any sort of effect on the condition. GO term
enrichment analysis identified several over-represented gene sets which
are differentiated between stage I and stage IV LUAD. These categories
make sense given background knowledge of the condition. DNA replication,
cell cycle regulation, and cell division are some pathways that are
over-represented, and also happen to be biological processes I theorized
would be likely to be upregulated. Interestingly to me, GSEA identified
ribosome-related genes as highly significant in differentiating between
the two conditions. I did not know this when I began the project, but
this makes sense, as ribosomal processes are highly upregulated if cell
division increases. There was also a surprising amount of enriched gene
sets related to keratin and skin, which is surprising given the location
of the condition. I am not entirely sure why this may be the case, and
it could warrant a future direction of study. The remaining gene sets
were mostly unsurprising, such as ones related to DNA repair or the
immune system.

As per the suggestion of course staff, the majority of the figures
discussed in this section are contained in the "Methods" section
following this one, to allow for a consolidated understanding of the
full next generation sequencing (NGS) pipeline from start to finish. The
relevant subsections are subsections H and I, with the referenced
figures contained within.

<br>

## Methods

For the sake of brevity and readability, a majority of the SLURM job
scripts referred to in this section will not be explicitly included,
save for a few specific lines. The scripts, fully annotated with code
comments, can be found in the Github repository respective to this
project. For a given figure, if code is not included in R, then that
figure was created via MultiQC and imported. Bash code will not include
code comments, as they exist in the full scripts. R code will include
light commenting where relevant.

#### A. Dataset Selection.

Once the question and hypothesis were identified, a suitable dataset was
located on the National Library of Medicine's Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO). It was required that the data was bulk RNA-seq, sourced from LUAD
NSCLC tissue samples, and had six or more samples per condition. As a
naive approach, any dataset with less than twelve total samples were
excluded. Datasets focusing on mutant cell lines were also excluded.
Beyond these strict requirements, preference were given to datasets
associated with a published paper, under the assumption that such data
had a higher chance of being of adequate quality and would be easier to
find additional information about. Other additional preferences included
datasets with human samples, and datasets updated within the last year.
Depending on the specific keywords used, there might be other viable
datasets on GEO which fit all these requirements and preferences.
However, with the keywords I ended up choosing, these characteristics
narrowed the selections down to Series GSE251840.

#### B. Dataset Characteristics.

Series GSE251840 is associated with a paper titled "Transcriptomics
profiling of the non-small cell lung cancer microenvironment reveals
dual immune cell-type behaviors" published on October 1st, 2024 by
Hurtado et al. (2024). It consists of sixty-two samples, divided among
four conditions- stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV-
representing the progression of the condition. The samples are made up
of lung cancer tumor tissue, which were collected as part of a
prospective cohort from consenting patients diagnosed with NSCLC. The
sequencing platform used was Illumina NextSeq 500, and the data was bulk
RNA-seq. The pipeline was followed for all available samples up until
the exploratory data analysis section. However, since it was decided to
narrow down the research hypothesis to comparing the transcriptomes of
stage I and stage IV respectively, only 41 of the original 62 samples
ended up being relevant for the final analysis. For additional clarity
in the figures, the 21 samples respective to stage II and stage III are
left out of any figures and discussion, but most QC, alignment, and
other steps were run for these samples as well.

Of additional note was the source of the sequenced RNA. The RNA was
extracted from tumor tissue samples in the form of formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides. FFPE is a form of long-term
preservation. After extraction, the library was prepared with the KAPA
RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase (HMR) from Roche. The authors, Hurtado
et al., state the original tissue samples came from a tumor library
created and maintained by the CHU Biological Research Center, meaning
that it was not collected by them personally. These aspects of the data
are relevant to the later quality control (QC) subsections, and will
also be touched upon when reviewing problems and limitations in the
discussion section.

#### C. Downloading the Data

Since there are 62 samples associated with this dataset, it was
necessary to utilize a loop to download all the relevant fastq files
onto the Cayuga workspace automatically. To retrieve each sample, I
utilized the SRA-toolkit, a Bioconda package which allows for direct
access to International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC) data. This allows for the retrieval of .fastq files based on
their Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession codes. A .csv list of all
accession codes associated with the samples in the series were
downloaded from the NCBI website. (National Center for Biotechnology
Information, 2024) After the .csv was moved to the working directory,
the script downloadData.sh was run:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
prefetch $SRR
fastq-dump --split-files --gzip "$SRR/$SRR.sra"
```

As can be seen, retrieving the fastq files involves running "prefetch"
for each accession number, and then "fastq-dump" on the resulting .sra
file. The parameters --split-files downloads the two ends of the
paired-end reads into separate files, so they can be analyzed separately
if desired. My initial run of this command did not include the --gzip
parameter, which I learned about later on. This resulted in downloading
uncompressed fastq files, while the rest of the pipeline mostly calls
for .fq.gz format. Thus, I further ran a simple script zip.sh to
compress all the fastq files. After learning about the --gzip parameter,
I modified my original script, which would eliminate the need for
zip.sh. However, I did not see the need to re-run the download step as
the final output would be the same. In the future, using --gzip would
save substantial runtime.

To run the alignment algorithm and other QC steps, a reference genome
and .gtf annotation file were also needed in the working directory. As
the relevant reference genome for my project is human, I downloaded both
files from the GENOCODE project website using wget. Of the available
options, GTF file chosen was "Comprehensive gene annotation", while the
selected fasta file was "Genome sequence, primary assembly". (Frankish
et al., 2023)

#### D. Pre-Alignment QC and Trim-Galore

With the data downloaded, the next step in the pipeline was to run
pre-alignment QC to ensure that there were no issues with the raw fastq
files. The main issues one would be looking for at this step are sample
contamination and degradation, which if severe enough, would make a
sample liable to be discarded. I was also checking to make sure that one
condition was not distinguishable from the other in QC, as this would
indicate dataset-compromising batch effects. The specific tool utilized
was FastQC, and it is run for each individual sample. I wrote a simple
script, runFASTQConly.sh, to loop through all samples and run FastQC for
each, but only the command itself is shown below. The main notable
aspect is the --extract parameter in the fastqc command, which is needed
for the .fq.gz formatted files.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
fastqc  --extract \
    -o "${output_dir}/${base}" \
    "$input_dir/${base}_1.fastq.gz" \
    "$input_dir/${base}_2.fastq.gz"
```

FastQC generates metrics and a .html report for each individual fastq
file. However, it is not practical or useful to interpret each report
individually. Thus, I used the MultiQC tool to consolidate the FastQC
outputs into a human-interpretable format. MultiQC automatically
searches the input directory for relevant files and metadata, as well as
categorizes them accordingly, so all one needs to specify is the input
and output directories. This applies to later analyses like
FeatureCounts and QoRTs as well. I used a script called runMultiQC.sh to
store its command call, but it is relatively straightforward. After the
consolidated report was created, I went in and filtered out all the
reads for Stage II and Stage III, which are genotypes that are not
relevant to the project, as mentioned before. I then grouped and
highlighted the two conditions of interest to distinguish them on the
plot. Stage I is highlighted in light blue, while Stage IV is
highlighted in red. Note that as a matter of formatting, MultiQC
automatically omits some sample labels to preserve readability.

```

for each sample.](f1_fastQC_only.png)

<br>

The plots shown in figure 1 help quantify the overall quality of the
samples. The main point of figure 1a. was to compare between conditions.
If a particular condition unexpectedly has noticeably larger read counts
than the other, this could indicate some sort of experimental design
flaw and batch effects. The point of figure 1b. was to identify any
samples compromised by a large amount of bad reads. If a given sample
has high amount of sequences with low average Phred Scores, that sample
would be liable to be excluded. If a particular condition has worse
Phred scores than the other, that might compromise the dataset as a
whole. In this case, both these plots did not highlight any glaring
issues, and therefore I moved onto more specific plots.

```{R, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load in images
img1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("/Users/franklynwu/Documents/ANGSD/multiqc_plots_fastqc_only_project/fastqc_adapter_content_plot.svg")

panel <- plot_grid(img1, img2, img3, img4, ncol = 2)
ggsave("f2_fastQC_only.png", panel, width = 20, height = 10)
```

![**Figure 2**. More detailed fastQC plots shown from the left to the

<br>

On a high level, the plots in figure 2 were used to check for various
forms of contamination. Figure 2a is pretty straightforward, and
indicated if any known adapters were detected in the sample reads. While
trace amounts of adapter contamination were seen, the results from this
plot do not indicate any significant problems. Only one sample slightly
crosses the line beyond acceptable levels of adapters in the reads.
Furthermore, if adapter content were high, we would be expecting a more
parabolic-looking curve, with noticeably increased levels at both ends
of the reads. Figure 2b is the most interesting. It indicates that
several samples had a noticeably high percentage of over-represented
sequences. One might initially suspect adapter contamination, but the
MultiQC report indicates these samples were mostly
"NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN", with some
"GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG" sequences as well.
Both of these sequences are indicative of failed reads, and are not
unexpected for data of this nature. Figure 2c shows the GC content
density plots for each sample. One would ideally expect to see a
consistent normal distribution across the dataset, and that is roughly
what can be observed in the plot. Of note are the random spikes on the
left end of the plot. These spikes likely correspond to the failed reads
indicated in figure 2b, but fortunately do not correspond to only one
condition. Finally figure 2d would is used mostly in tandem with figure
2b. If there are random spikes unexpectedly in the plotted line(s), that
could indicate various forms of contamination. However, this plot is
unremarkable in that regard, which corroborates the idea that the the
anomalies in figure 2c come from the failed reads identified in figure
2b, and not adapter contamination.

All things considered, these FastQC results did not subjectively
indicate necessity for trimming. There are only six samples where the
failed reads were potentially problematic, and in these samples, the
percentage of the overrepresented sequences were mostly below five
percent. However, as best practice, I opted to still use trim-galore in
an attempt to remove the failed reads to improve the quality of the data
as much as possible. An excerpt of the script runTrimFastQC.sh is below.
The notable parameters are --paired, which is required for paired-end
data, and --illumina, which essentially indicates which adapters might
appear in the samples. I also used the --fastqc argument to
automatically re-run fastqc after the trimming was complete, with
--fastqc_args used to pass in the aforementioned --extract parameter
when doing so. -j is an optional argument used to allocate more threads
to run the command, speeding up runtime.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
trim_galore --paired \
  --fastqc \
  --illumina \
  -j 4 \
  --fastqc_args "--extract --outdir=${output_dir}/${base}/fastqc_out" \
  --output_dir "$output_dir/$base" \
  "$input_dir/${base}_1.fastq.gz" \
  "$input_dir/${base}_2.fastq.gz"
```

# Use ggplot2 to draw both plots as subpanels of one figure, then save
panel <- plot_grid(img1, img2, ncol = 1)
ggsave("f3_trim.png", panel, width = 5, height = 5)
```

![**Figure 3.** Overall status checks of FastQC results before and after
triming, top down- **3a.** Status Checks Before Trimming **3b.** Status
Checks After Triming.](f3_trim.png)

<br>

Comparing the FastQC quality plots before and after running trim-galore,
there are noticeable improvements in "Per Base N Content", "Adapter
Content", and "Mean Quality Scores" plots in the post-trim data.
Additionally, the failed "NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN" reads are
almost entirely eliminated. To save space, instead of including all the
individual plots from FastQC a second time for this section, I've
included both heatmap summaries of FastQC for before and after trimming
for easy comparison. This is what is seen in figure 3. There are clear
improvements in the "Per Sequence GC Content" section and the
"Overreprsented Sequences" section. Note that "Per Base Sequence
Content" being in the red is somewhat common for RNA-seq data.

#### E. Alignment Using STAR

Following QC and trimming, it was appropriate to begin aligning samples.
The two options were STAR and BWA. I chose STAR because it's more
optimized for spliced alignments which is relevant for RNA-seq data. It
is also more time efficient, which is important because my sample size
is fairly large.

The first step necessary to run alignments was to generate a genome
index, which would be used in the alignments of all samples. This is
done in makeIndex.sh, which can be found in the GitHub repository. The
most important part of this script is the function call, which is below.
The first parameter tells STAR the process being run, ie. generating a
genome index. The next three input lines are the output directory,
reference genome, and .gtf annotation file respectively. Of these, the
latter two files were downloaded in subsection C. The parameter
"sjdbOverhang" is required and is set to the read-length of the data
minus one. It helps improve mapping accuracy and quantification by
helping STAR generate splice junction sequences which match the length
of the samples being aligned. One can easily determine read length
directly in bash by using zcat and grep on the fastq.gz files.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
STAR --runMode genomeGenerate \
 --genomeDir "$index_out" \
 --genomeFastaFiles "$assembly" \
 --sjdbGTFfile "$gtf" \
 --sjdbOverhang 75 \
 --runThreadN 16
```

Once the genome index was generated, I ran STAR alignments for every
trimmed sample. This loop is in runSTAR.sh. Again, only the function
call in this loop is shown below. Like before, the first parameter
defines what the process is being run, while the following two parameter
are the input files. The second parameter is the genome index which was
just generated, while the following is the sample being aligned. Note
that since our data is paired end, and I chose to split the fastq files
for each end, I needed to submit them together for the STAR alignment.
The entry for --readFilesCommand is necessary due to the samples being
in compressed format, while --outSAMtype defines the output file format.
What is important besides specifying BAM format is including the flag
SortedByCoordinate, as some later steps explicitly require sorted
inputs.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
STAR --runMode alignReads \
    --genomeDir "$indir" \
    --readFilesIn "$fwd" "$bkwd" \
    --readFilesCommand zcat \
    --outFileNamePrefix "$sample" \
    --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate \
    --runThreadN "$threads"
```

![**Figure 4.** Star Alignment Volume- This is a stacked bar chart.
Mapping is measured by volume, not
percentage.](/Users/franklynwu/Documents/ANGSD/star_alignment_plot.png)

<br>

MultiQC helpfully compiled the mapping rates printed by STAR onto
graphic plot. As can be seen, a majority of the reads for all samples
are uniquely mapped, which was necessary to confirm before proceeding
with the next steps of the pipeline. If the percentage of unique mapping
was low, then it would indicate that the genome index or the parameters
for the STAR function calls were incorrect for the data, or that the
data itself had some quality issue that required additional
pre-alignment QC to understand.

#### F. Using IGV to Confirm Stranding

Some of the steps following alignment requires users to specify whether
the data is strand-sensitive or not. It is important to provide the
right inputs/parameters in this regard as this will affect the
performance of tools like FeatureCounts. Based on the sequencing
platform identified by the researchers, I already expected the data to
be antisense and stranded. However, it is best practice to confirm this
oneself, as researchers can be mistaken about the characteristics of
their data or how it was gathered. I examined the alignment outputs for
several samples, including SRR27318695 and SRR27318750, in IGV and
determined that the data qualitatively was antisense. I also ran an
RseQC function called "infer_experiment.py" on all samples. The function
makes a guess on the standed specificity of a given sample based on the
alignments within.

![**Figure 5.** Strand Specificity Inferences By RseQC for All
Samples](/Users/franklynwu/Documents/ANGSD/rseqc_infer_experiment_plot.png)

<br>

Figure 5, the output of running infer_experiment.py on all samples, is
somewhat concerning because at least 35% of the samples do not seem to
be antisense stranded according to RSeQC. After looking at specific gene
regions for some samples IGV, I thought the undetermined group may come
from the fact that for some samples, many individual reads fragments are
gray, meaning that they're either low quality or they may map to both
strands. Given what was already known about the sequencing platform
based on GEO, the undetermined group may not be a major problem. The
small minority of samples identified as sense-stranded is most alarming
though. I am not really sure why this might be the case, especially if
the sequencing platform used was consistent. This could be especially
concerning if all the sense strands come from a given condition.
However, due to being short on time, I was unable to examine this
further and opted to proceed with read counting and post-alignment QC.

#### G. Read Counting and Post-Alignment QC

FeatureCounts (FC) is used to to quantify gene reads from the alignment
output files. This is necessary for further analysis. For the purposes
of Post-Alignment QC, the options are RSeQC or QoRTs. I chose QoRTs
mostly because I had more experience using it. Both FC and QoRTs can be
run simultaneously, which is why they share a subsection.

The FC script is runFC.sh. The command call for this script has been
excerpted below. The first parameter is optional and tells FC to
allocate more threads for processing to speed up runtime. The next two
parameters are the input annotation file and the desired output file
prefix. The next four parameters are required and important. To begin
with, -t tells FC which feature type to count. Often, the input for this
parameter is exon. However, I chose gene because the samples' library
preparation method, that being rRNA depletion, does not eliminate
intronic reads. By extension, counting gene assignments rather than exon
assignments drastically increases the unique assignment rate and thus
the statistical power of downstream analyses. The next parameter tells
FC what attribute to group by. The exact phrase needed will depend on
the annotation file and the intention of the researcher; gene_id is
fairly standard for the human reference genome. The next parameter has
to do with the fact that the data is paired-end. Failing to specify -p
can severely skew the data. I added the additional flag --countReadPairs
so that a fragment is not double-counted if it exists in both the
forward and reversed strands. Finally -s 2 has to do with fact the data
is strand-sensitive. Based on subsection F, I chose the input two for
this parameter to indicate antisense-stranded data.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
featureCounts -T 16 -a $inGTF -o $outfile -t gene -g gene_id -p --countReadPairs -s 2 -Q 10 ${indir}/*Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
```

The QoRTs script is runQorts.sh. The command call for QoRTs has also
been excerpted below. Of the parameters, the last three are input files
representing the alignment output file, the annotation file, and the
desired output location, respectively. Otherwise, the only strictly
necessary parameter is --stranded, which indicates that this data is
stand-sensitive. --maxReadLength is highly recommended, however, so I
passed in the known read length of my samples. This parameter is used to
avoid any potential errors that might occur by having QoRTs infer the
read length itself.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
java -jar /athena/angsd/scratch/mef3005/share/envs/qorts/share/qorts-1.3.6-1/QoRTs.jar QC \
    --stranded \
    --numThreads 24 \
    --maxReadLength 76 \
    "$bam" \
    "$inGTF" \
    "$sample_outdir"
```

```{R, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load in images

# Use ggplot2 to subfigure images and then save them
panel <- plot_grid(img1, img2, ncol = 1)
ggsave("f6_FC.png", panel, width = 5, height = 5)
```

unassigned reads, for each sample. **6b.** QoRTs Assignment Volumes By
Location- plots showing raw amounts of exonic reads, UTR reads, and
intronic reads, among others](f6_FC.png)

<br>

From an examination of Figure 6a above, we can identify an assignment
rate that seems to hover around 70%. This is adequate for the purposes
of further analysis. As a note, there if using -t exon instead of -t
gene, the assignment rate falls to around 30% across samples. This is
because of the high amount of intronic sequences in the sample, which
will be touched upon later. The purpose behind including this figure is
to do a preliminary spot-check on the FC output and make sure assignment
rates are not unexpectedly low, as this would indicate that something
has gone wrong earlier in the pipeline. If the assigned reads or
intronic reads were only high for some samples, that would be
problematic as well. However, as can be seen in both 6a and 6b, this is
not the case. Intronic reads are high for all samples. Referring again
to 6b, we can note that across all samples, volume of reads for exonic
reads is still well over ten million. Since there are no identifiable
batch effects, these numbers were still high enough to proceed with for
DEA and other analyses while purely aligning to the exon and not the
gene, if that was desired. Of course, this would require re-running
runSTAR.sh At this point, I also saved the results.txt file to my local
R environment, as later on, the output of FC will need to be read in to
perform any expression analyses like DEA or GSEA.

Following an initial examination of the FC assignment rates, more
detailed information can be gleaned from the post-alignment QC results
from QoRTs. By default, QoRTs generates an extensive series of plots for
each sample, but two are generally considered the most important-
"Mapping Location Rates" and "Gene-Body Coverage". QoRTs has a companion
R package with helps read in its output and allows for the direct
generation of figures on the R markdown file. I chose to have the
figures "colored by group", meaning that they are separated based on
condition. Note that to successfully read in the data, QoRTs requires
the creation of a decoder. The purpose of this decoder is to help QoRTs
assign labels and metadata to the data it's reading in. You can
pre-create a text file to read into R as the decoder, but I felt it more
convenient to automatically create the decoder in R.

**Figure 7.** Read Mapping Location Rates Colored by Group- Mapping
location densities binned into various categories and separated by Stage
I and Stage IV are shown.

<br>

Figure 7 above shows the read mapping location types for all assignments
in the alignment file, separated by condition. Something I checked for
immediately that there was no obvious and significance difference
between the conditions. While in the context of this project, some
variation in read distribution might be expected between conditions, a
large difference would potentially indicate some form of experimental or
technical error. Note that the "Unique Gene" and "No Gene" bins are
cumulative, with the former including all the entries in "Unique Gene
UTR" and the latter including all the other "No Gene" categories. What
was immediately of most interest was the "No Gene Intronic" section. In
a library prepared with poly(A) enrichment methods, one would expect a
properly prepared and aligned sample to have a relatively low level of
"No Gene Intronic" reads. Thus, this was a major concern for me upon
originally viewing the QoRTs output. However, upon doing further
research into the library preparation method utilized by the original
researchers who prepared the samples, I found out that said method only
includes rRNA depletion and not poly(A) enrichment for mature mRNA. As a
result, the high level of "No Gene Intronic" reads would not be
unexpected for this dataset, and it does not indicate any technical
error with the pipeline or QC issue with the samples. The rest of the
"No Gene" bins are as expected, which was relatively low. These sections
would correspond to the presence of intergenic reads. The "Ambig Gene"
being high would potentially indicate gDNA contamination, but it was
also relatively low. The "Unique Gene UTR" bin seems to contain about
18% of reads for both conditions, which is not an unexpectedly high
amount for full-transcriptome RNA sequencing.

```

**Figure 8.** Gene-Body Coverage By Group- from the top down. **8a.**
Total Gene-Body Coverage by Group. **8b.** Gene-Body Coverage for Upper
Middle Quartile By Group

<br>

For Gene-Body Coverage, I generated two plots, one for all genes, and
then one for genes in the middle-quartile of expression-level. The
latter is recommended by the QoRTs manual because high-expression and
low-expression genes can skew the plot for different reasons, so it's
common for many researchers to refer to the latter subpanel. In an idea
scenario, we would have a uniform distribution for the gene body
coverage, meaning the generated plots would be nearly a straight line.
This is practically impossible in reality. Thus, what we want to look
for instead is 3‚Äô bias and uniformity across samples. The 3' bias in
both samples is not especially pronounced, which is a good sign that the
sample quality is relatively high and not heavily degraded. What is also
important is to ensure that degradation levels are not more pronounced
as a whole for a particular condition vs. the other. For this dataset,
again, there does not seem to be any unexpected or noticeable
discrepancy between Stage I and Stage IV groups.

df_coldata <- data.frame(condition = c("Stage III", "Stage III", "Stage I", "Stage IV", "Stage II", "Stage II", "Stage II", "Stage II", "Stage III", 
"Stage II", "Stage IV", "Stage IV", "Stage IV", "Stage IV", "Stage I", "Stage I", "Stage II", "Stage III",

                         row.names = colnames(gene_sample) )

# Create DESeq2 object using metadata and gene counts
dds_LUAD <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = gene_sample,
                            colData = df_coldata,
                            design = ~ condition)

# Remove genes with no expression
keep_genes <- rowSums(counts(dds_LUAD)) > 0
dds_LUAD <- dds_LUAD[ keep_genes, ]

# Add condition to the sample names themselves for figure readability later on
colnames(dds_LUAD) <- paste0(colnames(dds_LUAD), "_", dds_LUAD$condition)

# Create a copy for later use before filtering out stage II and stage III samples
dds_LUAD_all <- dds_LUAD

# Remove stage II samples and stage III samples
dds_LUAD <- dds_LUAD[, !(dds_LUAD$condition %in% c("Stage II", "Stage III"))]

# Remove the stage II and stage III conditions to prevent matrix rank issues 
dds_LUAD$condition <- droplevels(dds_LUAD$condition)

# Re-level based on stage I as the "baseline"
dds_LUAD$condition %<>% relevel(ref="Stage I")
dds_LUAD

# Apply variance stabilizing transformation to both dataframes. These are meant for EDA.
vs_dds_LUAD <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds_LUAD, blind = TRUE)
vs_dds_LUAD_all <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds_LUAD_all, blind = TRUE)
```

The first step was to load the FC counts into a DESeq2 object for
normalization and further analysis. I modified the sample column names
for brevity, removed the metadata columns, and manually read in the
condition assignments. I then also filtered out all Stage II and Stage
III related columns, as well as removing the conditions themselves. If
the conditions are not removed, this will lead to matrix rank issues
later on in differential expression analysis (DEA). I also appended the
conditions to the sample names to vastly increase interpretability for
later figures. Information about the final DESeq2 object is printed
above. As can be seen, we have 41 columns corresponding to our 41
samples (for Stage I and Stage IV), which is expected. There are 59349
genes with at least one read in any of the samples, out of 78724 genes
that are present in the original annotation file. Later on, in GO term
enrichment, our universe will be the former set. I then also did a
variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) on all the read counts. VST is
typically better for clustering and exploratory data analysis, but later
down the line, I applied normalization instead where it is more
appropriate. With the transformation applied, the data was ready for
exploratory data analysis.

```{R, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
library(pheatmap)

# Extract matrix of expression values 
vsd_data <- assay(vs_dds_LUAD)
conditions <- vs_dds_LUAD$condition
# print(conditions)
# Use cor() to calculate correlation coefficients for each pair of samples, specifying pearson correlation coefficient
corr_coeff <- cor(vsd_data, method ="pearson")
# Transform matrix of correlation coefficients into a distance matrix

as.matrix %>%
# Create heatmap, hide vertical dendrogram, make size modifications for legibility

    treeheight_row=0,    
    cellheight = 12) 
```

<br>

**Figure 9.** Pearson Correlation Heatmap

<br>

To generate the generate the heatmap in figure 9, I followed the
standard code utilized in class. The metric being compared between
samples here is the VST read counts, which is represented by pearson
correlation coefficient. A qualitative analysis of the heatmap shows
four defined clusters. One cluster is clearly stage I and another
cluster is clearly stage IV, but the other two seem mixed. The reason
for two separate "mixed" groups to exist is highly interesting. If it
were one, it might be that this group marks borderline cases, but
clearly there is some major overlap between the stage I and stage IV
conditions. If assumes that LUAD follows a consistent continuous
progression, this would be highly unusual. Thus, the dendrogram
indicated some heterogeneity between LUAD progression, at least when
quantified by pearson correlation coefficient. This outcome indicated
that as a whole, these conditions, perhaps do the high amount of
features and high level of heterogeneity in LUAD, may not be easily
distinguished based on their expression profiles.

**Figure 10.** PCA Plots Via Different Methods- from the top down.
**10a.** PCAPlot() output. **10b.** Manually created plot of prcomp()
PCA output. **10c.** PCAPlot() output including Stage II and Stage III
samples.

<br>

I generated the PCA plot in two separate ways. The first, seen in figure
10a, was to use the plotPCA function provided by DSEq2, which is
relatively straightforward. In the second, figure 10b, I first conducted
PCA using the prcomp() function which is in-built into the base R
package. I then manually plotted the output from those functions. The
results of the plots are slightly different. The reason for this isn't
entirely clear to me, as the PCA method itself should be the same for
both. I assume that plotPCA() applies certain transformations that
differ from the ones I did manually. For instance, I opted not to
normalize and to only use VST for PCA, while plotPCA() might
automatically do both, or only normalization. I also applied a transpose
for the manual PCA which seems to have not been done with the plotPCA()
output. Regardless, both plots show that the dataset is actually
relatively separable over the PCA vectors with respect to Stage I vs
Stage IV. With the exception of a couple outliers, one can draw a
straight line through both plots to separate a majority of both
conditions into two respective groups. As an additional note, I also did
PCA for all four conditions, one of which can be seen in figure 10c.
This PCA plot is highly inseparable across all four conditions, with a
high degree of overlap between all groups. This indicates that the
overall progression of LUAD is heterogeneous and complex, bringing into
question the significance of comparing only Stage I and Stage IV.

#### I. Differential Gene Expression Analysis

The final step in the methodology was to perform DGEA to obtain results
to make inferences upon. In the code, the first line applies the DESeq()
function to the dds_LUAD object and writes it back into dds_LUAD. The
main important call afterwards is results(), which is a DESeq2 function
which applies the statistical tests that ultimately produce fold change
and significance values. Note that for results(), I used the
untransformed DSeq2 object, because DSEq2() automatically applied
necessary transformations for the output during this step.

```{R, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Apply DESeq() to un-normalized, un-transformed dataset
# This automatically estimates size factors, dispersions, and fits bionmial GLM to each gene, while computing wald stat
dds_LUAD %<>% DESeq()
# Apply results() function to conduct DGEA, set significance threshold
df_results <- results(dds_LUAD, independentFiltering = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
# Print amount of significant vs insignificant genes (TRUE is significant)
table(df_results$padj < 0.05)
# Write histogram of adjusted p-values
df_results$padj %>%
  hist(breaks=19, main="Adjusted p-values for Stage I vs Stage IV")
```

<br>

**Figure 11.** Histogram of Adjusted p-values for All Four LUAD Stages.

<br>

The histogram above in figure 11 shows the adjusted p values for all
genes in the system. Adjusted p-values are needed instead of raw
p-values to control the false discovery rate in the cases large-scale
data analysis like this one, with many thousands of hypothesis tests
performed at once over all the various genes with read values. What one
would look for in this chat is a sizable amount of density on the left
end of the plot. This indicates the genes which fall under the threshold
for significance, in this case, p \< 0.05. If the plot was skewed to the
right end, then the conditions being compared may not be suitable to
perform DGEA over.

```{R, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
# Sort results based on significance
df_results_sorted <- df_results %>% `[`(order(.$padj),)
# Filter out insignificant genes
genes_dge <- rownames(subset(df_results_sorted, padj < 0.05))
# Normalize base on size factors using rlog()
rld_LUAD <- rlog(dds_LUAD, blind = FALSE)
# Apply assay to DGEA results
norm_dge <- rld_LUAD[genes_dge,] %>% assay
# Plot heatmap of the assay, hide vertical dendrogram
pheatmap(norm_dge, scale="row",
        show_rownames=FALSE, treeheight_row=0, main="DGE (Row-Based Z-Score)")
```

<br> **Figure 12.** Heatmap of Scaled (by Z-Score) Counts for Genes
Across Samples. <br>

To get a better idea of the high-level differential expression results,
I generated a scaled heatmap of the gene counts over all the samples.
This can be seen in figure 12. I first filtered only for significant
genes based on the 0.05 adjusted p-value cutoff, and then sorted the
genes based on expression, which is necessary for interpretability. Then
I normalized the expression levels, and applied row-wise z-score scaling
for the final plot. I felt the scaled results would be more meaningful
than the raw ones because some genes are naturally expressed at a far
lower magnitude than others. I removed the gene-based dendrogram on the
y-axis because at the amount of genes present, it is not
human-interpretable and merely adds visual noise to the figure. As can
be seen, an expression-based heatmap groups the conditions cleanly
together, far better than pearson correlation coefficient does. Although
faint, there is a clear "four-square" pattern where there are genes that
are upregulated for stage I but downregulated for stage IV on the top,
and vice versa on the bottom. There is one interesting Stage IV outlier,
but other than that the two conditions are very easily separated by
DSEq2.

```

<br> **Figure 13.** Volcano Plot of Genes in Terms of Significance
(-Log(Adjusted-P Values)) over Log_2-Fold Change. <br>

I also generated a volcano plot using the output of the previous
results() call, which can be seen in figure 15. The y-axis of this plot
is the negative log_10 of the adjusted p values, meaning that the higher
the y-axis value, the more significant. The x-axis is log_2 fold change,
meaning that left-side genes are downregulated while right-side genes
are upregulated. As recommended, I applies lfcShrink() to the data,
which drastically reduces the Log_2-fold change values of genes for
which significance, either due to low expression levels or weak signals,
is in question. I then used the annotation package org.Hs.eg.db to
replace the Ensembl IDs with "gene symbols", ie. colloquial gene names.
This improves interpretability for the figures. An important note is
that my original ENSEMBL gene IDs were formatted with a version number;
one example is ENSG00000177352.10. However, including this version
number means that the gene ID will not be able to map onto the gene IDs
organism database. The version number and decimal must be removed for
all gene IDs, which I did with gsub. Also of note is the fact that my
gene IDs were in ENSEMBL format and not ORF like in the template code.
However, not all IDs seemingly had respective gene symbols in the
organism database, so I left these names as is by writing them back into
my list of updated gene designations for any term that was NA. As a
result, in the volcano plot, some genes are identified like
"ENSG00000210127" and "ENSG00000248551", while others are "RGS1" and
"UPK1B". In the EnhancedVolcano() call itself, the main important
parameter was pCutoff = 0.05. This reduces the noise in the figure
significantly by only including significant genes. From this plot, it's
especially interesting to me that some of the highly significant genes
are uncharacterized.

**14a.** GSE of All Ontologies. **14b.** GSE of Solely Biological
Process Ontologies. <br>

I followed the DGE analysis with a gene-set enrichment anlaysis (GSEA).
GSEA is useful for gaining a higher-level and more intuitively
biological perspective of the results of the DGE analysis, especially
for cases like mine where I did not have the background knowledge to be
interested in any particular genes or subset of genes. What it
essentially does is group genes together based on established biological
information about their function and behavior, and performs statistical
tests on those sets, rather than individual genes. Like with previous
tests, I filtered out all genes which didn't meet the 0.05 significance
threshold before proceeding. gseGO also requires that you sort the input
by significance, which I did as well. For GSEA and GO term enrichment
analysis below, it is highly important that the version, ie. ".10" in
"ENSG00000177352.10", be removed from the gene IDs, as these analyses
explicitly require the GO database to function. I also changed my
minimum gene-set size retroactively to be consistent with the changes I
made in the GO term enrichment analysis. In the plot itself, the
upregulation of skin-related gene-sets being significant surprised me,
as LUAD takes place in lung tissue. However, most gene sets made sense
given my limited understanding of cancer, including DNA repair, nuclear
division, and leukocyte-mediated immunity. I generated two figures, one
which included all ontologies, figure 14a, and one which focused only on
biological processes, 14b.

<br> **Figure 15.** GO Term Enrichment Tree Map from REVIGO <br>

I also did a GO term enrichment analysis as a final form of analysis for
my results. This approach is different from GSEA by focusing on the
genes which were already identified in the DE analysis earlier on. What
this does is choose which GO terms are over-represented in the DEG
profile outputted by DESeq2, based on a few user-defined parameters.
Compared to GSEA, GO term enrichment focuses on the most significant
processes represented in the differential expression profile. This can
be seen by the relatively few GO terms I have. My DEG set was 9,344
genes long, of a universe of 51,836 genes, and goEnrich() only returned
18 enriched GO terms. Since the point of GO term enrichment is
identifying over-representation, a larger DEG set or universe doesn't
necessarily mean one would expect more enriched GO terms. Still, this
might be a surprisingly small amount from my limited understanding,
given how complex of a condition LUAD is. On the other hand, it would
make sense for GO term enrichment to only return the most important
biological processes for the differentiation between stage I and stage
IV, for which the results absolutely make sense. Mitotic cell cycle
process, cell division, DNA replication, and etc. all would naturally
play a massive and direct role in how LUAD progresses. Like with GSEA,
enrichGO() requires usage of the organism database, which means I had to
modify all my gene IDs to exclude the version from the ENSEMBL ID. For
the function call itself, I made several changes from the template code.
To begin with, I had to increase the significance cutoff from 0.05 to
0.1, making it less stringent. I also increased the minimum gene set
size from three to the default of ten. I did this because under the
original minimum, there was only one GO term at the significance cutoff
of p = 0.1. Increasing this parameter selects for broader GO terms with
more genes involved, rather than highly specific processes which would
be more selective about which genes are relevant. Because GO term
enrichment is about over-representation, eliminating the smaller gene
sets can increase the amount of enriched GO terms by reducing the noise
of the DEG set and as well the correction pressure which arises from the
high amount of statistical tests performed for each GO term. A good way
to visualize all the GO terms together is using a tree map, which can be
generated via REVIGO. REVIGO is a browser-based program and takes a list
of GO term outputs from enrichGO() and their respective p-values. The
script for the output can be downloaded, and the result of which is
figure 15. I modified this figure by removing group-level labels,
because there are not that many GO-terms, so they end up being
extraneous and a distraction. In the map, the size corresponds to the
negative log of the p-value, so larger size means more significance.

## Discussion

Overall, I felt that the dataset I chose was fairly high quality,
meaning that as a whole there were little problems to overcome. For
instance, the raw data didn't really necessitate the use of trim-galore,
although I went and did it anyway with the idea that it could only help.
For all the QC plots I examined, there was no distinguishable difference
between the conditions, which is ideal and means that technical batch
effects are unlikely. I was especially impressed with the gene-body
coverage plot, which to me represented a fairly low level of RNA
degradation.

However, there was one major hiccup with my results, which I touch upon
a bit in the analysis figure 7. This is the high level of intronic reads
in all the samples. These intronic reads meant that my assignment rates
for featureCounts on the exon level were relatively low compared to the
total sample sizes, around 30% for most. However, my raw volumes for
exonic reads were still high enough to proceed with the analysis if
desired. Upon doing some research, I came to the conclusion that the
library preparation kid used by the researchers who collected the
samples did not include poly(A) enrichment, and only rRNA depletion.
(Roche Sequencing Solutions, n.d.) As a result, I came to the conclusion
that the library preparation is likely the main the reason why intronic
reads are so prevalent. Since this is an expected result of the library
preparation, the intronic read volume should not present a significant
problem as they will be consistent across samples. If desired, one can
simply exclude them by counting exons only when running FC. I chose to
leave them in by counting on the gene-level to include as much data as
possible. However, this might have been a bad approach depending on
context, as this means that splicing can result in the over-estimation
or under-estimation of significance for certain genes. In general, not
doing poly(A) enrichment might be a severe problem. This is because not
all pre-mRNA eventually becomes mature mRNA, and pre-mRNA has its own
life cycle. For instance, for a particular gene, the processes which
transform pre-mRNA to mRNA might take place at a slower rate than the
transcription of pre-mRNA from DNA. Thus, a gene might have a vastly
higher expression significance if factoring in pre-mRNA. All this
depends on the biological question being asked; mine was fairly broad,
so I think the difference is not too important. However, if I had a more
targeted question about a particular biological process or cellular
function, then this difference might matter a lot.

While I was trying to confirm that the reason behind the high level of
intronic reads, I learned about another potential problem. The tissue
samples from which RNA was extracted were FFPE slides, which refers to a
method of long-term preservation. This is relevant because some
literature suggests there is a statistically significant effect on the
quality of the RNA sample, which may extend from increases in RNA
degradation. The authors of "Comparison of whole transcriptome
sequencing of fresh, frozen, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
cardiac tissue" found statistical significant decreases in properly
assigned reads in samples taken from FFPE tissue compared to fresh and
even normally-frozen samples. The researchers state that it is possible
that both the storage conditions and the unique procedure necessary to
prepare the samples for RNA extraction may lead to degradation of RNA.
(Jacobsen et al., 2023) Notably, if some samples were extracted from
FFPE tissue and some were not, this risks introducing batch effects, but
fortunately this was not the case for series GSE251840. Based on
post-alignment QC, the RNA degradation in my samples actually seemed
low, so I am unsure how much this potential problem mattered.

A potential issue touched upon in figure 5 was one which I did not have
the opportunity to explore further, that being the results of
infer_experiment.py. This was actually a function I found by myself and
ran out of curiosity. Given the sequencing platform and the qualitative
assessments of several samples in IGV, we would expect that all the
samples would be antisense stranded. The fact that infer_experiment.py
determined at least several to be sense stranded, and more to be
ambiguous, could indicate a major problem. The first possibility is that
the researchers utilized a mixed protocol for reading the samples,
meaning different sequencing platforms were utilized at different
points. This would be highly problematic due to the high risk of
introducing batch effects. The second, slightly less severe potential,
is that the quality of the alignments in some samples were low to the
point that the gene regions sampled by infer_experiment.py did not have
a good coverage to properly identify strand-specificity. Other potential
influences include DNA contamination and reverse transcription biases.
The most likely explanation in my opinion is the high amount of
multimapping reads in some samples. If I could correlate the highest
multimapping rates to the sense and undetermined strand-specificity
samples, then this would be a likely explanation. Unfortunately, I
discovered this late into the project timeline, so I was unable to do
this. In the end, I do not think it would be a major problem because the
amount of sense samples were relatively low, and the other QC results
seemed acceptable. Based on the sample information on GEO, I think it
would be a reasonable assumption that all samples were antisense, and so
I proceeded.

A technical challenge I frequently had to deal with while progressing
with the pipeline was the high runtime. Given that I had sixty-two total
samples and all my samples were relatively large, with some reaching as
high as sixty-million read pairs, my runtime was exorbitantly long. This
was exacerbated by the fact that I did not initially realize SRA could
download my samples pre-compressed. Compressing my samples took several
days of runtime. Other processes, such as trim-galore and QoRTs took
more than thirty-six hours to run on all sixty-two samples. Due to
mistakes with parameters and changes in procedure, I had to run some of
these functions several times. In hindsight, I should have excluded the
Stage II and Stage III samples from the beginning, since I was never
planning to use them for DGEA or GO term enrichment analysis. However, I
was curious about how they would affect EDA, and also leaving open the
window to modify my hypothesis. If I made minor mistakes, this could
result in heavily lost time. For even higher-throughput projects, I can
definitely see how managing runtime becomes a major logistical priority.

In regard to potential high-level problems, since this is
clinically-gathered data, there is a large amount of uncontrolled
variability inherent to the dataset which is important to keep in mind
during analysis. Additionally, this data was presumably gathered over an
extended period of time, one should consider whether efforts were taken
during tissue sample collection to maintain continuity between samples,
otherwise batch effects might arise. The researchers state the original
tissue samples came from a tumor library created and maintained by the
CHU Biological Research Center, which could potentially be contacted to
further inquire about sample method connection.

As a more abstract problem, I think my biological question and
hypothesis are not particularly meaningful. Stage I and stage IV are
expected to be highly different pathologically, so it is almost a
trivial exercise to perform EDA on their transcription profiles.
Examining the LUAD condition from such a high-level nonspecific
perspective means that a vast amount of genes will be significant. In my
case, around 9,300. This means that the results themselves will be
inherently hard to extract any interesting or useful information from.
This is why the GO term enrichment analysis returned only a few enriched
terms, which were the most expected results for a condition like as
LUAD- ie. cell division. Since the point of this project was more-so to
focus on methodology rather than extracting highly significant results,
this is not necessarily a problem, but a qualifier for the results and
their interpretation.
